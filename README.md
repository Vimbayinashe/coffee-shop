# coffee-shop

A group project to build a fullstack single page web application with Vue CLI, Express.js and SQLite.

The concept is based on an e-commerce service that sells coffee and coffee-related products. There is also a Control Panel for staff to check stock (with category option) and orders, including editing individual product price and quantity.
